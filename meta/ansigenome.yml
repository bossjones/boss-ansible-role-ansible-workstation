  synopsis: |
    `boss-ansible-role-workstation` is an Ansible role which builds and installs Debian
    package with specified Ansible version (by default, `devel`). It can be
    used to easily create remote Ansible Controller host or test your playbooks
    on a `devel` Ansible version in a container or VM.

    If `redis-server` is found on managed host, this role will automatically
    enable support for host fact caching in Ansible.
